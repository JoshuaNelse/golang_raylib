# TODOs
- maybe make a 4th map layer for redundant floor tiles to fill gaps
  - this would allow to put pieces like the pillar base as background (lower case)
- make foreground calculate by player center and not top of the sprite
  - hoping this will reduce some of the strange issues with foreground objects 
- make projectiles collide with environment
- Lay down an NPC (non-enemy)
  - make interactable
- make enemy spawn logic
- Implement UI
  - player health
  - player inventory
  - money
- Add damage attribute to weapons
  - Implement healing weapons
- some strange bug with weapon rotation breaking handle logic
  - see keytar with rotation set to anything other than zero (try 90)
