# TODOs
- think about breaking out code into modules (or calling it done for this POC)
- maybe make a 4th map layer for redundant floor t i
les to fill gaps
  - this would allow to put pieces like the pillar base as background (lower case)




# IN PROGRESS
- Implement Range
  - switchable weapon - DONE
    - 1 sword - DONE
    - 2 bow - DONE
  - implement velocity
  - draw arrow sprite



# DONE
- Setup Map level Collision detection
  - add third set to map file with collision mappings (for collideable spaces)
- implmenent foreground logic for uppercase tiles
- Setup seperate collision space for combat (finer cell size?)
  - Update: Can't do this. Instead made the main collision space finer grained
  - Another Update: Actually ended up using a different library for this since resolv had limitations
- Make player face mouse location (not movement direction)
- Add a weapon (anchor to player)
  - make weapon go behind player when turning towards dominant hand
    - Update: decided to flip the weapon instead
  - make a weapon move during an attach (left click)
  - maybe some sounds effects for swords
- drop an enemy in game
  - make it collideable with sword
